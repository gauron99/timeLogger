# TimeLogger
    App for logging activity time-wise and activity-wise
    -- Little app to log time activities manually
    -- input a name of the activity and 'start it' by clicking <Return> or 'start' button
    -- sets up time of start a locks in the name
    -- when activity is ended, calculates some stuff with time && log it in


# TODO
    file stuff aka open file, write in file
    how to work with a file in python
    one file - all info
    log text format (below)
    redo the innit func in main.py -- init everything in class itself and call only .config after (aka have only 2 funcs for operating not 3)

    time
        dda
        dad

# log format
    possible ideas:
    I.
        day | time-spent | activity | time-start | time-end
        --- //next day
        day | time-spent | activity | time-start | time-end   
        
    II.
        day | time-spent | activity | category | notes | time start->end
