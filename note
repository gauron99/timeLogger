timelogger -- 22.06.2021

- log time manually - work with internal clock
- start activity
    -- activity has name
    -- time of start
    -- additional note (text) possible
- have a secondary activity during a main one?
- when activity is started, its 'locked in' aka another main activity cannot start until first one is finished
- everything is saved into .txt or something like that
    -- when activity is started 'save' it in the app ( on screen ) -> aka -> time, activity, note ( everything that will be logged )
    -- possibility of the app crashing and not saving -- maybe implement some anti-crash mechanic like
       having the start of the activity and the duration of it until the crash ( it will say that the app crashed instead of finished activity)
- possibly (dissallow?) using the log file while an activity is running/app is open
- save into txt file / microsoft excel -like- program? having the possibility of easier counting total numbers and everything?
